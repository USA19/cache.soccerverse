# Cache - Soccerverse

A cache for datasets from [David Schoch's Soccerverse](https://github.com/schochastics/football-data).


## Why Cache the Datasets?

### What's unchanged?

The club names get copied as is incl. typos.


### What's changed?

The datasets here use the football.csv "standard", that is, one datafile
per season and league. The league code becomes the file name and the season the
directory name e.g. `2018-19/eng.csv` or `2018-19/es.csv`
